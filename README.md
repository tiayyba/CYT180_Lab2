# CYT180 – Lab 2: Pandas DataFrames

**Weight:** 3% <br>
**Work Type:** Individual <br>
**Submission Format:** Single PDF file containing screenshots from the Jupyter Notebook <br>

---

## Lab Objectives

This lab introduces Pandas DataFrames, a foundational tool for data analytics used extensively in cybersecurity for analyzing logs, alerts, and structured datasets. You will prepare your environment, learn Pandas basics through a guided video, and complete a hands-on exercise using a CSV file. The icnstructor will demoinstrate the use of Pandas during the in-person lab session.
By the end of this lab, you should be able to:
- Load CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame
- Inspect and explore tabular data
- Filter data using conditions
- Clearly document and explain analysis steps
---

## Environment Setup
You will work in Jupyter Notebook using a local Anaconda installation that you did in week1.
Verify that the following libraries are available:
* `pandas`
* `bottleneck`
* `numexpr`
* `matplotlib`

If any library is missing, install it using:

```python
!pip install pandas bottleneck numexpr matplotlib
```

## Task 1: Pandas Exercise (Submission Required)

You are provided with the file **`cities.csv`**.
Create a new Jupyter Notebook and complete the steps below **in order**.
* 1. Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
* 2. Display basic DataFrame information
* 3. Display the first and last rows using `head()` and `tail()`
* 4. Select and display the names of cities located in the state **CA**

---

## Documentation Requirements

* Take a screenshot for **each step** above
* Each screenshot must show:
  * The Python code
  * The output produced
* Paste all screenshots into **one MS Word document**
* Add brief comments explaining what each step does

## Reference Material

The following materials can help you complete this lab. These are **optional** and meant for guidance only:

1. Instructor demonstration of the concepts
2. Additional Python tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp
3. Pandas Crash Course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhYC02PD_gc
   - Below the start page you will see the list of Chapters in this video, and timestamps. Watch at the minimum up Data Exploration (17 minutes of video).

## Submission Instructions

All lab work must be submitted as a **single PDF file** on Blackboard containing screenshots of your notebook. You should create a **Word document**, add all screenshots in order, and then convert it to PDF.<br>
Follow these steps carefully:
1. At the top of each task cell, include your **name and student ID as a comment**.  
     Example:
     ```python
     # Name: Your Name
     # Student ID: 123456789
     ```
4. **Demonstrate work was done on your own machine**:
   - Open a **Windows Terminal** (or command prompt).  
   - Print your **system username**, **current date**, and **current time**. You will capture this output along with code.
4. Capture screenshots of all tasks in the notebook:
   - Each screenshot must show code and its output in the cell along with your system username, and current datetime from terminal. You can keep the terminal on the right side of notebook and then capture the screenshot.
   - Place each screenshot under its corresponding task heading (Task 1, Task 2, … Task 8).
5. Compile the word document as a PDF:
6. Check before submission:
   - All notebook screenshots clearly show your name and student ID along with system username, current date and time from the windows terminal.
   - All 8 tasks are included and clearly labeled.
   - Code runs correctly and outputs are visible.

## Final Reflection

At the bottom of the word document, answer the following questions:
1. Which task helped you understand Python the most?
2. Which task was the most challenging and why?
3. What is one Python concept you feel confident about after completing this lab?

Each answer should be **2–4 sentences**, written in your own words.
